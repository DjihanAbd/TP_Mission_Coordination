# TP_Mission_Coordination
This file contains the different strategies developped for the Mission Coordiantion Lab for the SAAS masters.
The objective of this Lab was to ensure that a system of 3 robots arrive to designed flags without any collision. 
We first try a simple timing solution, then developped a more robust one using odometry of the robot. We tested the robustness of our solutuon by adding some obstacles to the envirenement.
